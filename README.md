# My projects
## ðŸ“– What you can read
### ðŸ“— Book: [LLMOps. Make AI Work For You.](https://boramorka.github.io/LLM-Book/)
I have authored a guide that serves as an essential resource for Data Scientists, ML Engineers, Software Developers, and other professionals who find themselves navigating the complex landscape of modern artificial intelligence technologies. This book is crafted to demystify the complexities inherent in AI applications, with a focused lens on Large Language Models (LLMs), conversational AI, and the nuanced process of integrating LLMs into development workflows, particularly emphasizing the tailored application of Machine Learning Operations (ML Ops) for these models. My goal is to equip readers with the knowledge and tools needed to harness the potential of AI technologies, guiding them through the intricacies of this rapidly evolving field with clarity and insight.

The methodologies and insights provided in this book extend beyond theoretical understanding, illustrating how LLMs can be seamlessly integrated into various business scenarios. From enhancing customer service with conversational chatbots to personalizing user experiences through recommender systems, and optimizing operational efficiencies with ML Ops, the application of LLMs across different facets of a business is both broad and impactful. This guide emphasizes the fundamental application skills required to implement LLMs in any business process, highlighting the versatility and transformative potential of these models in driving innovation, improving decision-making, and creating value. By bridging the gap between complex AI technologies and practical business applications, this book equips professionals with the knowledge to not only navigate the landscape of artificial intelligence but to also leverage it as a powerful tool for business growth and innovation.

## :iphone: :computer: What you can touch: One API and 3 ML Apps

### :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: **API:** [(GITHUB LINK) Social network API with authentication and votes](https://github.com/boramorka/API_dev) :hammer_and_wrench:
- Built with **FastAPI, PostgresSQL and SQLAlchemy**
- Deployed on **Heroku** + **Docker** container for your own testing
- You can check demo in project repo

### :large_blue_diamond: **ML App:** [(GITHUB LINK) Telegram bot. Like Adobe Reader, but in your pocket.](https://github.com/boramorka/text-extraction-app) :iphone:
- [Bot telegram link](https://t.me/boramorka_text_extraction_bot) - take a photo of some document and bot will send you a text that you can copy.
- Deployed on **Heroku**
- You can check demo in project repo

### :large_blue_diamond: **ML App:** [(GITHUB LINK) Emotion detection Windows App](https://github.com/boramorka/Emotion_detection_v1) :computer:
- Requires **NVIDIA CUDA**
- You can check demo in project repo

### :large_blue_diamond: **ML App:** [(GITHUB LINK) Traffic sign prediction app deployed on Stramlit Cloud](https://github.com/boramorka/Traffic-sign-prediction-app_1) :computer:
- The model was trained on German road signs
- The application may be in sleep mode. In this case, you will see an offer to wake it up. You'll have to wait a couple of minutes.
- You can check demo in project repo

## :construction_worker: Recent Work Experience

* **As a Data Analyst:**
  - Implementation of various ML methods, visualization.
  - Weekly reports for the corporate business department.
  - Work at the COVID headquarters, where Sberbank initiated the deployment of a robot designed to gather data regarding the health conditions of its employees. My role involved conducting analyses to categorize areas into "green," "yellow," and "red" zones. This was done to identify early indicators of illness, with the aim of preventing severe cases of the disease and potential fatalities.


**romanenkor/romanenkor** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
